# ECE369_GoPlayer
A simple music serving web app. 

##Backend is in Go.
Because Go is so hot right now.

##Frontend is HTML, CSS, and jquery.
We like to keep is simple

##Serves from the music directory.
Which is a symlink right now but you should change that with a fork

##To Run:
```
sudo go run player.go
```

##To Install:
Because honestly why not?
```
go get github.com/DanGarcia595/ECE369_GoPlayer
```
